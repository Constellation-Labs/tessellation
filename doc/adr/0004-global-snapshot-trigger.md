# 4. Global snapshot trigger

Date: 2022-01-05

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Global snapshot must have a deterministic trigger so then snapshots created on
different nodes should converge (contains the same data) and pass the majority algorithm.

As described in [ADR#2](./0002-global-and-state-channel-snapshots.md), Global
snapshot contains both DAG blocks and StateChannel snapshots.
