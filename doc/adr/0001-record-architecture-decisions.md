# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-01-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in
this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences

We will keep our decisions described, so then we can revisit them later. Also,
we will be creating a public input for later usage and documentation.
